       <p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black">Abstract-In the present world, social media has become a very important part of our lives. We share so much content every day ranging from what we are doing in our personal lives to professional information. For some, it's a source of income due to its marketing capabilities and for some, it's a platform to share their content, for some it's a platform to raise their voice, and for some, it's a platform to connect to the world. In fact, some social media platforms have become a political playground also. Many decisions, ideas, events are shared on these platforms, consider the case of twitter many heads of countries share updates on this platform. But with all these things we know social media has a problem due to its centralized nature. </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black">
we have seen password leaks by twitter users and forceful banning of accounts due to political influence. Also, the advertisers may not know whether the ads they are promoting are not influenced by these companies. All these things force us to adopt decentralization and this project has tried to implement that.
